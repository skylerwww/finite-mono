# Deploying finite-sites to finite-lat-2

## Today's flow — DEPRECATED (build-on-box)

This is a historical summary of the former build-on-box flow that produced
the v0.2.16 binaries:

1. From a dev machine: `rsync -az --delete` the finite-sites source to
   `finite-lat-2:~/finite-sites/` (excluding `.git`, `target`, env files).
2. On the box: `cargo build --release`.
3. On the box: `sudo install -m 0755 target/release/{finitesitesd,fsite}
   /usr/local/bin/` — previous binaries are kept alongside as `*.prev-<stamp>`
   (e.g. `finitesitesd.prev-20260619T155747Z`), which is the rollback path.
4. `sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart finite-saas-sites`,
   then curl the public health/serving endpoints.
5. Unit/Caddy changes: `sudo install` the files from this tree
   (`infra/hosts/lat2/systemd/`, `infra/hosts/lat2/caddy/Caddyfile`), then
   daemon-reload / `systemctl reload caddy`.

Why deprecated (infra/README.md deploy principles 1–2): the on-box checkout
is rsync'd, **not a git repo** — the running binaries have no commit
provenance; the build toolchain lives on a prod box; and "what was on the
box" is unreproducible from a tag. Since `.git` is excluded by the rsync,
provenance is structurally absent, not just unrecorded.

## Target flow — binaries from release tags

1. **CI builds** `finitesitesd` + `fsite` at a component release tag
   (`fsite/v*`, per the mono tag scheme) as release artifacts, on a runner
   with the right labels (see `runners.md` — cutover to finite-mono
   required first).
2. **Deploy script** (to live in `infra/runbooks/`, idempotent, takes an
   explicit tag): downloads the tagged artifacts and rsyncs the **binaries
   only** — never source — to the box; `sudo install -m 0755` to
   `/usr/local/bin/`, keeping the `*.prev-<stamp>` copies exactly as today;
   restarts `finite-saas-sites`.
3. **Verify what was deployed**: the script must confirm the running version
   matches the tag before declaring success — today that is
   `finitesitesd --version` (0.2.16 at capture) plus
   `curl https://api.finite.chat/api/v1/healthz`; the finitechat-style
   contract gate (a health endpoint reporting an automatically derived
   artifact fingerprint) is the bar
   once finitesitesd exposes it.
4. Rollback = `sudo install` the `.prev` binary back and restart, same as
   today.

At the time this superseded flow was written, config units, Caddyfile, polkit,
and sudoers deployed from this tree rather than from the sites source checkout.
ADR 0028 later removed the Sites app-runner polkit/sudoers files from the
current tree.

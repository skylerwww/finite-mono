# Finite Deployment

Finite Deployment is the language for turning reviewed Finite source and
artifacts into production state. It distinguishes user-consumable releases,
server-side deploys, Agent Runtime eligibility, and existing-Agent migration.

## Language

**Source Authority**:
The repository whose branches, tags, and reviewed commits are authoritative
for Finite development and delivery.
_Avoid_: Canonical repo, main repo

**Public Mirror**:
A publicly readable projection of the Source Authority that is not itself an
authoritative path for accepting or releasing changes.
_Avoid_: Source Authority, backup

**Release Host**:
The system that durably publishes Product Release assets and their stable
download locations.
_Avoid_: Source Authority, CI artifact store

**Release Repository**:
A repository used only to publish Product Release metadata and assets, without
being a Source Authority or accepting product implementation changes.
_Avoid_: Source Authority, Public Mirror

**Artifact Registry**:
The system that durably publishes immutable server and Agent Runtime images
for deployment by digest.
_Avoid_: Release Host, build cache

**Shadow Run**:
A non-authoritative delivery execution used to compare a candidate path with
the current path without publishing artifacts or mutating production.
_Avoid_: Dry run, canary deploy

**Hard Cutover**:
The validated transition after which the successor path is authoritative and
the superseded execution path is removed rather than operated in parallel.
_Avoid_: Shadow Run, gradual rollout

**Product Release**:
A signed, user-consumable product artifact published for installation or
download.
_Avoid_: Release when referring to server-side production state

**Production Deploy**:
A change to production server-side infrastructure or service state.
_Avoid_: Deploy when referring to Agent Runtime rollout

**Runtime Artifact Promotion**:
Making an immutable Agent Runtime artifact eligible for future Agent launches.
_Avoid_: Runtime deploy, image tag

**Runtime Rollout**:
Moving existing Agents to a promoted Runtime Artifact while preserving their
durable state and identity.
_Avoid_: Bot rollout, deploy

**Deployment Manifest**:
The desired production-state record used to decide what a deployment should
attempt and what evidence must be recorded.
_Avoid_: Deployment queue, release notes

**Production Branch**:
The git branch whose tip represents the source revision intended for the
production environment.
_Avoid_: Release branch, deploy queue

**Deployment Record**:
The durable evidence left by a deployment attempt, including the intended
source revision, observed production state, verification results, and outcome.
_Avoid_: Grafana dashboard, workflow log

**Deploy Principal**:
The actor authorized to perform production deployment mutations.
_Avoid_: Operator laptop, root shell

**Mutation Boundary**:
The point in a deployment attempt after which cancellation becomes an
interrupted production mutation that must be reconciled before later deploys.
_Avoid_: Cancel point, deploy start

**Deployment Classification**:
The declared risk class of a deployment attempt, especially whether ordinary
binary rollback remains a valid response.
_Avoid_: Change type, release type

**Risky Path Set**:
A conservative list of source paths that require stronger Deployment
Classification when they change.
_Avoid_: Blocklist, forbidden paths

**Deployment Plan**:
The pre-mutation preview produced for a production promotion, naming the
intended source revision, classification, gates, artifact build, and expected
mutation.
_Avoid_: Deployment Record

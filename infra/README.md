# infra/ — the single deploy root

Everything Finite runs in production is defined here. The north star:

> A release tag in finite-mono is sufficient, by itself, to reproduce any
> artifact we ship and to deploy any service we run. Nothing is built on a
> prod box. Nothing requires knowledge that lives only in someone's shell
> history.

## Post-cutover headline (2026-07-09)

**finite-lat-1 is now the consolidated NixOS app server, and it runs the whole
coupled cluster.** Its definition is `infra/nixos/` (host `finite-lat-1`); the
2026-07-09 reinstall transcript is
`infra/runbooks/lat1-nixos-reinstall.md`, but destructive reuse is paused while
the finite-lat-3 capacity/redundancy plan produces a recovery-proved
replacement.

What the 2026-07-09 lat1 consolidation cutover changed:

- **One app server, one config tree.** finite-saas-core, Finite Identity, dashboard,
  finitechat-server (migrated off clawland), finitesitesd (migrated off lat2),
  finite-search, and Postgres all run on lat1, defined in `infra/nixos/`.
- **Native Postgres.** Postgres 16 is a `services.postgresql` systemd service
  (db `finite_core`, 87 Finite Private keys) — **no more k3s StatefulSet**.
- **One Caddy edge.** A single Caddy on lat1 fronts `finite.computer`,
  `brain.finite.computer`, `chat.finite.computer`, `*.finite.chat` (Cloudflare Origin CA), and
  `*.docs.finite.chat`; the exact `identity.finite.vip` record joins it when
  the Identity Authority deployment is accepted. **No Traefik, no k3s, no
  socat bridges.**
- **`nixos-rebuild` is THE deploy.** Deploying a release pins the flake to the
  rev that tagged the binaries. The old *six distinct deploy mechanisms* — k3s
  `kubectl apply` + on-host `podman build` (lat1), systemd + Kata (lat2), Nix
  fleet `just host-deploy` (smoke/clawland), and the hand-run finitechat script
  — are **resolved for the coupled cluster**: one NixOS closure for
  `finite-lat-1`, built by CI as a downloadable file binary cache and switched
  by `scripts/deploy-lat1-closure-cache`. On-host `podman build` is gone;
  first-party images are CI-built and digest-pinned (`infra/images/`).

Still elsewhere: lat2 is a decommission target. Historical captures that need
to live in git are under `hosts/lat2/`; any remaining private host archive must
be moved off the machine through `runbooks/decommission-lat2.md`, then the
legacy runners and credentials are removed. It is no longer a Docker/image CI
host, Nix build host, deploy driver, or archive authority. Docker/image CI and
production closure builds run through Depot-backed CI.
**clawland** remains the legacy finite.vip fleet box; **Tinfoil** is unchanged.
The old FiniteBrain smoke service remains a rollback source, not the
production origin.

## First-cohort production baseline (2026-07-15)

The hosted-agent path is now in production with a proven fresh-Agent flow,
authenticated private Finite Sites Preview, Telegram pairing, and serial
digest-pinned upgrades of existing healthy Kata Agents. The exact deployed
checkpoint and future regression gates are recorded in
[`docs/runs/production-baseline-2026-07-15.md`](../docs/runs/production-baseline-2026-07-15.md).

`scripts/deploy-lat1-closure-cache ARTIFACT_DIR` switches infrastructure only.
An Agent Runtime image rollout is a separate two-command prepare/execute
operation: it names an exact promoted artifact and either explicit Project ids
or `--roll-all` plus an already-target canary, then requires the prepared plan
hash before mutation. Never infer a bot rollout from the word “deploy.”

Merged work not yet known to be released or deployed is tracked by surface in
[`deployment-queue.md`](deployment-queue.md). The queue is a handoff, not
production-mutation authority.

## Layout

```
infra/
  deployment-queue.md  # merged work awaiting a release/deploy/rollout
  nixos/       # finite-lat-1 AS CODE — the live definition of the app server
  hosts/
    lat1/      # finite-lat-1 (64.34.82.77) — PRE-CUTOVER k3s reference only (superseded by infra/nixos/)
    lat2/      # finite-lat-2 (64.34.80.19) — historical captures; host pending decommission
    smoke/     # ovh-vps-smoke (15.204.56.61, OVH) — legacy Brain rollback source
    clawland/  # clawland-ovh (15.204.108.57, OVH) — legacy finite.vip fleet box
  images/      # container image definitions; built ONLY by CI, pushed digest-pinned to GHCR
  monitoring/  # external monitoring dashboards and NixOS receiver docs
  tinfoil/     # pins + notes for the public Tinfoil satellite repos (measured enclaves)
  runbooks/    # per-service: deploy, rollback, backup/restore, break-glass
```

`infra/nixos/` is the declared source of truth for lat1. Every
`infra/hosts/<name>/` directory is a dated capture or migration record unless
its own banner explicitly says otherwise; it is not permission to deploy its
old units. `hosts/lat1/` describes the wiped pre-cutover k3s control plane, and
the Sites/Search material under `hosts/lat2/` is historical. The runner
inventory in `hosts/lat2/runners.md` is removal inventory for
`runbooks/decommission-lat2.md`; mono Docker/image CI is no longer scheduled
there.

## Hosts and services (observed topology, 2026-07-20)

This table is current-state authority, not a desired topology. A provider
server that is provisioning or under qualification is not deployed Finite
capacity. The one accepted next candidate and its hard gates live in
[`docs/runs/finite-lat-capacity-and-redundancy.md`](../docs/runs/finite-lat-capacity-and-redundancy.md).

| Host | Role | Services |
|---|---|---|
| **finite-lat-1** (64.34.82.77) | **Consolidated NixOS app server and existing-Agent Kata Runner** (`infra/nixos/`). NixOS 25.11; single-disk root and `/data`; no swap at the 2026-07-18 inventory. New creation is drained; the Runner timer remains active for existing-Agent lifecycle work. The private lat3 WireGuard path, peer-scoped firewall, Core socket proxy, and multi-Runner Core are active declarative configuration from merged PR #134; no runtime bridge override remains. | finite-saas-core (:4200), dashboard (podman :3000), **native** Postgres 16 (`services.postgresql`, `finite_core`, 87 FP keys), finitechat-server (:8788), finitechat-hosted-device (loopback only, per-WorkOS-user identity and encrypted store), FiniteBrain (:3015), finitesitesd (:8787), finite-search (SearXNG :8080 + Firecrawl), finite-saas-runner (Kata), a separately fenced **dark/disabled** Phala API worker definition, and **one** Caddy edge. NO k3s, NO Traefik, NO on-host image builds. Deploy: CI-built `lat1-nixos-closure-REV` artifact copied and switched by `scripts/deploy-lat1-closure-cache`. |
| **finite-lat-2** (64.34.80.19) | **Decommission target** (Ubuntu 26.04+nix at last inventory). Historical service captures are in `hosts/lat2/`; private legacy/archive data must be moved off-box through `runbooks/decommission-lat2.md` before repurpose or release. | No production service, CI, build, deploy, Agent capacity, recovery authority, or archive authority may run here. The installed GitHub runners are removal inventory only (`hosts/lat2/runners.md`). finite-saas-sites / finite-search / finite-core-tunnel are **DISABLED** and migrated to lat1. |
| **finite-lat-3** (207.188.7.157) | **NixOS 26.05 Agent Runner accepting new creation, hard limit 42.** Kernel 6.18.39; 187 GiB RAM; exact-size RAID1 root and `/data`; dual ESPs; 64-GiB swapfile plus zswap. | The Runner timer is enabled declaratively with `FC_RUNNER_DRAIN=false` and `FC_RUNNER_MAX_SANDBOXES=42`. This owner-authorized ceiling deliberately overcommits the declared 8-GiB guest maximum against physical RAM; swap is not counted as usable Agent capacity. No Recovery Authority exists here. |
| **smoke** (15.204.56.61) | Legacy Nix-fleet box; Brain rollback source | Legacy finite-brain on :3015 (`brain.smoke.finite.computer`). It is not a replica and must not be selected implicitly. |
| **clawland** (15.204.108.57) | Legacy finite.vip fleet box | Legacy `*.finite.vip` fleet (k3s + Traefik + oauth2-proxy, `finited`, ~50 agent namespaces). finitechat-server here is **DISABLED** (migrated to lat1). |
| Tinfoil | Measured enclaves (unchanged) | DeepSeek V4 Flash 0731 inference + finite-private-limiter enclave; searxng enclave. The historical container/hostname remains `kimi-k2-6`, and `glm-5-2` remains a mixed-version request alias. The limiter validates usage against **lat1** Core. Deployed from the public satellite repos (`tinfoil/`). |

## DNS (current)

- `finite.computer`, `brain.finite.computer`, `chat.finite.computer` → **lat1** (Namecheap).
- `*.finite.chat` → **Cloudflare** (Full strict) → lat1 origin (Cloudflare
  Origin CA cert); `*.docs.finite.chat` same edge.
- `brain.finite.computer` is the canonical production Brain signing/API
  origin. The WorkOS-protected embedded client remains under
  `finite.computer/client`; its capability names the canonical Brain origin.
- `identity.finite.vip` is the canonical Finite Identity signing/API origin.
  Only its exact record moves to lat1; the `finite.vip` apex and wildcard stay
  on the legacy fleet.
- `brain.smoke.finite.computer` / `*.smoke.finite.computer` → smoke, retained
  only as an explicit rollback target.

## Secrets policy

**No secret values in this repo, ever.** The private Origin repository is not a
secret store, and its Release Repository is public. Secrets live where they
run: on lat1, root-owned `/etc/finite/*.env` and
`/etc/finite-saas/` files (bootstrap checklist in `infra/nixos/README.md`);
Tinfoil sealed secrets; Phala sealed env; the legacy fleet's k8s Secrets on
smoke/clawland. Each host README documents which secrets each service needs —
variable **names** and where the value lives, never the value. If you find a
secret value committed here, rotate it first, then delete it.

CI-only operational secrets live in Depot CI with the narrowest repository and
workflow scope that supports the lane. `CACHIX_AUTH_TOKEN` is the Cachix write token for the `finite` binary
cache used by the CI Nix service package job. The cache must remain readable
without that token for forked pull requests to substitute from it.

## Images

First-party images are **built by CI**, tagged with the git SHA, pushed to
GHCR, and deployed by digest (`infra/images/`). On-host `podman build` (the old
lat1 k3s pattern) is gone: the confidential-compute company's control plane
does not run binaries built from "whatever was on the box." The lat1 dashboard
runs a digest-pinned image under podman; core and the sites/chat/brain binaries
are built by Nix from `infra/nixos/packages.nix`.

## Tinfoil satellite

Tinfoil enclaves are deployed from the public satellite repos, not from here —
`infra/tinfoil/` holds the pins and notes. The Finite Private limiter enclave
validates usage against lat1 Core (`FINITE_USAGE_API_SERVICE_KEY` pairs with
lat1's `FC_FINITE_PRIVATE_USAGE_API_TOKEN` — do NOT rotate at cutover).

## Deploy principles

1. **lat1 = `nixos-rebuild` from a release rev.** The rev that tagged the
   binaries is the rev the host runs. Rollback: `nixos-rebuild --rollback` on
   the host, or pin the previous rev. Source of truth: `infra/nixos/`. The old
   bare-metal transcript in `infra/runbooks/lat1-nixos-reinstall.md` is
   historical and not current wipe authority.
2. **Images are built by CI**, tagged with the git SHA, pushed to GHCR, and
   deployed by digest. No on-host builds.
3. **Binaries ship from release tags** (component-scoped: `finitechat/v*`,
   `fsite/v*`, `fbrain/v*`, `runtime-image/*`, `core/v*`).
4. **Deploy scripts / runbooks live here**, are idempotent, take an explicit
   ref/digest, and verify what they deployed (health endpoint reporting
   an automatically derived artifact fingerprint, like the finitechat server
   contract gate).
5. **Backups are only real once restored.** Before first-slice user data, every
   stateful service must have a service-consistent backup, an off-host copy, a
   restore runbook, and an empty-target restore drill. The current deployment
   does not yet satisfy this rule: lat1 is single-disk. The Hosted Web Chat
   module creates a service-consistent snapshot only when a deploy or operator
   triggers it; its disruptive 15-minute timer was removed after it broke live
   streams. Snapshot health currently tolerates seven days, and Borg ships the
   latest snapshot daily to the dedicated rsync.net repository. A verified
   first archive exists, but this is not a 15-minute RPO. Destination-side
   append-only restriction is recommended hardening; a non-disruptive cadence
   and complete empty-target restore remain known gaps. On 2026-07-20 Paul
   explicitly waived them as prerequisites for opening lat3 at a hard limit of
   32 Agents.
   Agent Runtime `/data` is not covered.
   The July 13 first-cohort Stripe exception remains history. No new Core/UI
   admission gate was deployed for the July 20 lat3 opening; the enforced
   bound is the Runner's 32-sandbox maximum. The matching lat1 disks contain
   stale metadata from the failed 2026-07-09 MD install; they are not clean spares
   and may be touched only by a serial-stable, separately authorized reinstall.
   A future mirror remains defense in depth, not a backup.

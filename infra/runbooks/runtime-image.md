# Building and promoting the agent runtime image

`ghcr.io/finitecomputer/agent-runtime` (mono-owned; the legacy
`finite-agent-runtime` package is frozen with the deployed pins) — the image
the lat1 finite-saas-runner will launch into Kata first and Phala as a fast
follow. Image
definitions map: `infra/images/README.md`. Rung-ladder discipline: see
[README.md](README.md) — no Kata/Phala/Tinfoil promotion without a Docker proof.

> **Runner status:** finite-saas-runner lives on lat1 as a NixOS systemd timer
> (`modules/finite-saas-runner.nix`) and advertises the Kata adapter. Phala is
> a fast follow and must consume the same artifact contract and image digest.

## PRECONDITIONS

- Native Depot CI access is available for the `depot-ubuntu-24.04` runner.
  Set `DEPOT_RUNTIME_IMAGE_PROJECT_ID` or the
  shared `DEPOT_PROJECT_ID` repository variable or secret for Depot remote
  container builds. The workflow authenticates through `depot/setup-action`
  OIDC. Image builds run in CI on ephemeral Depot runners/builders; lat1
  launches only the resulting digest-pinned artifact.
- The tree state you are building is on the ref you dispatch (the single
  checkout SHA pins finitechat + finite-sites + finite-brain + finite-skills
  together; that is the whole point of the mono adaptation — see the header in
  `.depot/workflows/runtime-image.yml`).

## STEPS

### 1. Optional preflight of the source revision

Dispatch **Hermes runtime smoke**
(`.depot/workflows/hermes-runtime-smoke.yml`) on the revision to promote. It
is test-only and builds the same canonical monorepo Agent Runtime Dockerfile as
the publication path; it cannot publish a second Hermes-only image. This is a
useful early source-level failure detector, but because it performs a separate
build it is not the promotion proof for the final digest.

### 2. Build and publish the one runtime image

1. On the reviewed revision, dispatch **Agent Runtime Image**
   (`.depot/workflows/runtime-image.yml`) with
   `version=<date-based, e.g. 2026-07-08.1>`. Hermes is repository-pinned to
   `0.20.0`, the same version exercised by every smoke lane. For future
   upgrades, move the reviewed pin in the image and all smoke lanes together;
   do not add a dispatch-time override.

   After the GitHub/Depot CI cutover, dispatch the production publisher directly
   through Depot. Confirm that the run's resolved source revision is the
   reviewed GitHub `main` revision before promoting its digest:

   ```sh
   git fetch origin --prune
   REV="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
   [[ "$REV" =~ ^[0-9a-f]{40}$ ]]
   git merge-base --is-ancestor "$REV" origin/main
   depot ci dispatch \
     --org scthc5h66g \
     --repo finitecomputer/finite-mono \
     --workflow runtime-image.yml \
     --ref main \
     --input rev="$REV" \
     --input version=2026-07-08.1 \
     --input publish_production=true \
     --output json
   ```

   This publishes a verified, digest-pinned image to GHCR. It does not change
   the artifact selected by Core, edit a host, restart a runner, or roll an
   existing Runtime; those are separate, explicit steps below.
2. The publication workflow builds exactly once via
   `finitecomputer-v2/scripts/build_runtime_image.py` from one staged
   finite-mono checkout and root Cargo lockfile, embeds the Finite Skills
   baseline, captures and cross-checks the immutable local image ID, and runs
   the durable Add/Welcome chat plus `/home/node` restart smoke against that
   image ID before any
   push. Only after that smoke passes does it push `:$VERSION` +
   `:sha-<sha>`, uploads `runtime-image-report.json`, and prints the pinned
   `ghcr.io/finitecomputer/agent-runtime:<version>@sha256:...` in
   summary. The uploaded durable-smoke report is evidence for the exact image
   that was tagged and pushed; copy the pinned ref — it is the only thing you
   promote.

**Recovery boundary:** the canonical image now has the narrow, one-shot
`recover_known_good` boot receiver and the snapshot-root contract covers all of
`/data`, including `/data/workspace`. That does not prove an
application-consistent, provider-independent Recovery Snapshot, independent key
custody, or an empty-target restore. Those remain separate paid-cohort gates;
do not describe the boot repair or a provider-volume restart as product
Recovery Readiness.

### 3. Promote to the lat1 runner

The runner does **not** read an image tag directly. On NixOS lat1 the env is
`/etc/finite/runner.env` (secrets bootstrap — `infra/nixos/README.md`;
template: `infra/hosts/lat1/systemd/runner.env.example`). The pin is:

- **`FC_RUNNER_RUNTIME_ARTIFACT_ID`** (e.g.
  `finite-agent-runtime-canary-20260702-41b0c6d`) — product launches fetch
  the promoted artifact **kind, reference, and state schema from Core**
  using this ID.

So promotion is two steps:

1. Register the new pinned image as an artifact in Core.
   Use Core's service-authenticated runtime-artifact registration endpoint;
   supply the OCI kind, immutable digest reference, source revision, and state
   schema, then promote that artifact for the Kata class. Recovery support is
   immutable artifact material: set `recoverKnownGoodChat=true` only for an
   image whose exact digest passed the one-shot recovery receiver tests. The
   additive field defaults to `false`, so older/N-1 artifacts and rollbacks do
   not inherit a control their image cannot execute.
2. Edit `FC_RUNNER_RUNTIME_ARTIFACT_ID` in `/etc/finite/runner.env` on every
   Kata host (lat1 and lat3). That operator file is the only place the pin
   exists: the Nix-rendered shared env deliberately carries no default, and
   the unit fails closed at start (`FC_RUNNER_RUNTIME_ARTIFACT_ID is
   required`) if it is missing. No restart needed: the timer re-invokes the
   runner with the new env (set `FC_RUNNER_DRAIN=true` first if you want
   in-flight launches to settle).

When introducing the artifact-capability column, drain new Kata creation before
the Core/Runner generation switch, register the new recovery-capable digest
through that generation, update `FC_RUNNER_RUNTIME_ARTIFACT_ID`, and only then
clear the drain. Existing lifecycle controls remain available while creation is
drained.

### 4. Record

Core's promoted runtime-artifact record is the deployment record. Hosted
agents pin at launch and do NOT auto-update, and existing Runtimes keep their
image until replaced, so Core's per-Runtime rows (read with
`scripts/finite-status`) are the only truthful list of images in the field.
Add an entry to `infra/deployment-changelog.md` only for what Core cannot
carry: why the image shipped and when a fleet roll completed.

Record the bundled Finite Skills source revision beside the image. New agents
seed that baseline once. Existing agents do not auto-update; users and agents
choose when to run `finite skills sync` against the image's tested bundle.
Core, RMP, and Runner have no desired-skills state.

### 4a. Upgrade an existing Kata Runtime explicitly

Promotion changes only the artifact used by future launches. A normal
`restart` is a same-compute operation for Kata and never adopts the newly
promoted image. Existing compute moves only through an explicit Runtime Upgrade
request bound to one artifact id:

Runtime Upgrade first use is staged across two Core generations. The first
generation ships the new schema/parser with
`FC_CORE_ENABLE_RUNTIME_UPGRADES=false` (the Nix default) and must be live long
enough to be the known-compatible rollback target. Only a later config-only
generation sets the gate to `true`. Never enable first use in the same
generation that first introduces the `upgrade` database value.

Before activating the compatibility generation, this preflight must return no
rows; the migration deliberately fails closed instead of guessing which
already-running provider operation to cancel:

```sql
-- Post-H1 lifecycle vocabulary: the active (non-terminal) states are
-- 'requested', 'launching', 'compute_up', 'ready'.
SELECT agent_runtime_id, count(*)
FROM runtime_control_requests
WHERE status IN ('requested', 'launching', 'compute_up', 'ready')
GROUP BY agent_runtime_id
HAVING count(*) > 1;
```

```text
POST /api/core/v1/admin/projects/<project-id>/runtime/upgrade
Content-Type: application/json

{"targetRuntimeArtifactId":"<promoted-artifact-id>"}
```

The admin endpoint uses the same Core-side admin identity headers and service
authorization as the other `/api/core/v1/admin/*` operations. Do not invoke the
Runtime `destroy` endpoint as an upgrade step: destroy intentionally offboards
the Runtime, removes its relay credential, and revokes its Runtime-scoped Finite
Private key.

After a canary passes, prepare the broad production cohort. Preparation reads
Core's deterministic scope, verifies the already-target canary, checks every
eligible canonical Kata container directly on lat1, and writes a mode-0600
reviewed plan under the ignored `.local-state/runtime-rollouts/` tree. It does
not enqueue an upgrade:

```sh
scripts/rollout-lat1-runtime-artifact \
  --prepare \
  --roll-runtime-artifact finite-agent-runtime-YYYY-MM-DD.N \
  --roll-admin-email operator@example.com \
  --roll-admin-workos-user-id user_operator \
  --roll-all \
  --roll-canary-project-id project_canary
```

Review the concise counts, exclusions, target digest/schema, and plan hash, then
run the copy-paste command emitted by preparation. It has the same scope and
adds only the approved hash:

```sh
scripts/rollout-lat1-runtime-artifact \
  --execute-plan-hash <approved-64-hex-plan-hash> \
  --roll-runtime-artifact finite-agent-runtime-YYYY-MM-DD.N \
  --roll-admin-email operator@example.com \
  --roll-admin-workos-user-id user_operator \
  --roll-all \
  --roll-canary-project-id project_canary
```

Execution recomputes the whole plan and provider snapshot before mutation. It
then rechecks each exact Runtime immediately before enqueueing and verifies the
target artifact, image, schema, writable `/data` bind, topology, and unchanged
Agent Principal afterward. It stops before the next Runtime on plan drift,
stopped or ambiguous compute, operation failure, timeout, wrong artifact, or a
failed postcondition. Every run mints a run id and stamps it on each retained
`events.jsonl` record, and the run's `final` marker is derived from the ledger:
`success` only when every planned Runtime passed postflight, `failure` naming
the failed Runtime, `interrupted` naming the resume point, or `noop` when the
approved plan had zero planned Runtimes. SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP record
`interrupted`; a run that died before any trap fires has a start with no final
and is reported by `--summarize` as `unknown/incomplete`, never success.
Re-executing the approved hash after an interruption is safe: the recomputed
plan may differ only by entries Core already records on the target artifact,
and each entry is reconciled before acting — already on target is verified and
skipped, an identical in-flight upgrade request is awaited (Core never
enqueues a duplicate), and anything else executes normally. The same wrapper
covers lat3 with `--host lat3` (default `lat1`); the plan is provably
single-host and mixed-host plans are refused. Core CLI calls always run on
lat1; only provider facts and Runner addressing follow `--host`.
For `--roll-all`, a canonical container that is already stopped is retained in
the hashed plan as `provider_not_running` and is never contacted, started, or
enqueued; healthy eligible Runtimes may continue. An explicitly selected
stopped Runtime fails instead of being silently excluded.
Do not edit a prepared roster to make it pass; prepare a fresh plan after
resolving the concrete drift. Do not use this rollout path to reconstruct
missing compute.

#### Lifecycle probe gate, skips, and the override

Before enqueueing each entry, the wrapper consults the runner's read-only
`lifecycle-probe` (the same probe `finite-status` reports): it proves the
platform can still stop or replace the guest, which Core state alone cannot
see. A non-operable verdict (`degraded`, `inoperable`, `unknown`) is a
**deliberate skip, not a failure**: the entry is not enqueued, the Agent
keeps serving its current artifact, and the run ledger records the full
probe report under an `entry_lifecycle_probe` / `skipped` event. Resolve a
skip by fixing the underlying lifecycle-control finding, then re-executing
the **same approved plan hash** — the skipped entry is the resume point and
runs normally once the probe is green. If prepare-time or execute-time
provider facts drifted instead, re-`--prepare` and approve the new hash;
never edit retained evidence.

For an exactly-one-agent emergency where the probe verdict is understood and
the upgrade must proceed anyway, add `--probe-override` to the execute
command. It requires exactly one `--roll-project-id`, hard-refuses
`--roll-all`, still runs the probe and records its full report, and converts
only the verdict into a loudly logged proceed (`entry_lifecycle_probe` /
`override` event, stderr banner, `probe_overridden` in `--summarize`);
provider-fact drift checks, preflight, postflight, serial order, and
stop-on-first-failure all still apply. A malformed probe report has no
verdict to override and remains a fail-closed skip.

Running `finite-saas-core runtime-artifact-rollout` directly by hand
**bypasses this entire gate** — the probe, the provider-fact drift checks,
and postflight verification — and is now reserved for break-glass situations
where the wrapper itself cannot run. Prefer `--probe-override` for any
forced single-agent upgrade; it keeps every other safety check intact.

For the Finite Private quota-notice rollout, keep this first wave to exactly
one explicitly named canary project. Before enqueueing, prove the new narrow
edge routes exist without consuming a real reset: invalid bearer requests to
both `GET /api/core/v1/finite-private/usage` and
`POST /api/core/v1/finite-private/usage/reset` must reach Core and return 401,
not an edge 404. After completion, inspect the one canonical Runtime and any
operation-scoped helper containers: exactly one running container may mount
that Runtime's `/data`, the old rollback helper must be stopped, `/contact`
must report the unchanged Agent Principal, and the runtime must successfully
reach the status control route after a successful turn. Exact notice routing
at synthetic 25%/10% thresholds is a Core/adapter integration-test gate; do not
mutate a real account toward a threshold merely to demonstrate it in production.
Do not enqueue a roster wave until this evidence is recorded. Each later Runtime is upgraded once directly to the same digest;
do not restart it separately for these batched adapter changes.

Core accepts the request only when all of these are true:

- the Runtime was created by Core with the Kata runner class;
- the target is a promoted, non-retired OCI artifact with an immutable
  `@sha256:` reference; and
- the target state schema exactly matches the mounted Runtime state schema.

The leased operation carries the resolved target artifact. The Kata adapter
pulls that digest before downtime, stops but retains the old container, starts a
candidate against the exact same host bind mounted at `/data`, and requires both
generic `/healthz` readiness and the same Agent Principal from `/contact`. Only
then does it rename the old compute to an operation-scoped rollback handle and
move the verified candidate onto the canonical Provider Runtime Handle. A
failure before or after the swap removes the candidate before restarting the
old image, so two containers never write the same `/data` concurrently.

On success, the runner completion records the actual artifact id, state schema,
loopback endpoint, and contact URL in the same Core transaction that completes
the operation. A retry that finds the exact target image on the canonical handle
verifies readiness and returns those facts without replacing compute again.

The runner persists the pre-upgrade Agent Principal before stopping the old
container. If it restarts between either provider-handle rename, it reconciles
the operation-scoped candidate/rollback topology before requiring the canonical
handle and compares the recovered target with that persisted Principal before
deleting the old compute.

Replacement compute does not copy the old image's entire `Config.Env`. It
carries only the runner-owned Runtime contract, explicitly provenance-labeled
user overrides, and credential-shaped secret values. Unowned defaults belong
to the target image and therefore change with the target release. Secret values
remain in the transient mode-0600 env file and never enter process arguments.

Verify after completion:

1. Core's admin Runtime overview reports the target artifact id and `online`.
2. `nerdctl --namespace finite inspect <source-machine-id>` reports the target
   digest and the unchanged `/var/lib/finite-saas-runner/kata/<source-machine-id>:/data`
   bind.
3. `/contact` reports the pre-upgrade Agent Principal, and existing chat,
   attachments, workspace, Sites state, and agentd ledger remain accessible.

This is an ordinary same-volume upgrade, not a Recovery Snapshot or empty-target
restore. A falsely labeled same-schema image can still mutate mounted data in an
incompatible way; the image smoke/promotion gate remains mandatory.

### Tinfoil canary handoff

If a Tinfoil canary is used, it consumes the same published Agent Runtime
digest after the canonical smoke. Do not rebuild or publish a Hermes-only
variant from the legacy handoff scripts. Satellite digest-pin mechanics live
in `infra/tinfoil/README.md`.

## VERIFY

1. Smoke evidence and the publication report name the same monorepo SHA,
   Hermes `0.20.0`, Runtime image digest, CLIs, plugin, bundled Finite
   Skills source, and the Nix-staged baseline toolchains (node, bun, deno,
   uv, Playwright browsers).
2. After promotion: the next runner-launched Kata Runtime comes up ready within
   `FC_RUNNER_RUNTIME_READY_TIMEOUT_SECS` and runs the new image. TODO:
   verify the Core runtime row, `journalctl -u finite-saas-runner` on lat1,
   `nerdctl --namespace finite inspect`, and the Runtime `/healthz` response.
3. Runtime status and the Product Release manifest agree on the image and
   component versions; no mutable branch or second runtime package is used.
4. `scripts/finite-status` shows the new pin on every Kata host, and
   `infra/deployment-changelog.md` says why the image shipped.

## ROLLBACK

1. Point `FC_RUNNER_RUNTIME_ARTIFACT_ID` (and the Core artifact record)
   back at the previous version; the 20s timer picks it up.
2. Existing Runtimes are unaffected either way (launch-time pin). For a Kata
   Runtime that adopted the bad image, explicitly request an upgrade to the
   previous promoted, same-schema artifact. Never use destroy as the first leg.
3. Leave the bad tag in GHCR (immutability > tidiness) but note it in
   `infra/deployment-changelog.md` so nobody promotes it again.

### Rolling Core back across Runtime Upgrade first use

Before first use, roll back only to the already-live compatibility generation;
it understands the new schema while the gate remains false. After an Upgrade
row exists, a binary older than the compatibility generation cannot parse that
history. Use this fail-closed rescue only when such an old-binary rollback is
unavoidable:

1. Set `FC_CORE_ENABLE_RUNTIME_UPGRADES=false` and stop the
   `finite-saas-runner.timer` and `finite-saas-runner.service` so no lease can
   move while inspecting provider topology.
2. Query `runtime_control_requests` for `kind = 'upgrade' AND status IN
   ('requested','launching','compute_up','ready')`. For every result, use the
   compatible runner
   generation to reconcile the operation-scoped Kata candidate/rollback
   handles to one healthy canonical handle, verify `/healthz`, `/contact`, the
   expected image digest, and the single `/data` writer, then let Core record a
   terminal success or failure.
3. Verify that the active-upgrade query returns zero. The rescue script refuses
   to run otherwise; it never guesses that an active provider mutation failed.
4. From the finite-mono checkout, run:

   ```sh
   psql "$FC_CORE_DATABASE_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 \
     -f finitecomputer-v2/crates/finite-saas-core/migrations/runtime_upgrade_rollback_rescue.sql
   ```

   The transaction audits every terminal Upgrade row, rewrites only its legacy
   parser-facing kind to `restart`, and restores the old CHECK shape. The
   original target, status, and operation id remain in the audit record.
5. Verify `runtime.upgrade.rollback_rescue` audit rows exist and no
   `kind='upgrade'` row remains. Only then activate the old Core closure. Keep
   Runtime Upgrade disabled until the compatibility generation is restored.

If an explicitly synced skills baseline is bad, replace the Runtime with the
known-good image while preserving `/data`, then explicitly run
`finite skills sync` again. The first slice has no revision-history rollback
command. Do not invent a Core, RMP, or Runner rollback channel.

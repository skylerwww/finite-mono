# finite-private-limiter image (runs inside the Finite Private Tinfoil CVM,
# port 8002). Moved from finitecomputer-v2/deploy/finite-computer/images/ and
# adapted for the finite-mono root build context. Build context: repo root.
# Built ONLY by .depot/workflows/service-images.yml.
#
# This image being built HERE closes the old split-brain: the source of truth
# crate is finitecomputer-v2/crates/finite-private-limiter (this repo), while
# the previously-deployed image was built from the legacy finitecomputer repo.
# The digest produced by CI gets pinned in confidential-kimi-k2-6
# (see infra/tinfoil/README.md).

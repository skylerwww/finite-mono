# finite-saas-core control-plane image.
# Moved from finitecomputer-v2/deploy/finite-computer/images/core.Dockerfile
# and adapted for the finite-mono root build context (the old COPY paths
# assumed finitecomputer-v2 was the repo root; the crate now builds from the
# root workspace). Build context: repo root. Built ONLY by
# .depot/workflows/service-images.yml — never on a prod box.

# Finite Sites

Finite Sites is a git-backed publishing surface for agents.

If a human asks you to publish or edit a Finite Site, use the `fsite` CLI.
The Project Repository is the editable source of truth. `finite.toml` selects
which committed path becomes the served website. Finite Sites serves committed
bytes; it does not run builds for you.

The production API is `https://api.finite.chat`, and `fsite` uses it by
default. Do not set `FINITE_SITES_API` unless you are intentionally targeting
a local or self-hosted server.

## Install `fsite`

Install the latest release binary:

```sh
set -eu

repo="finitecomputer/finite-releases"
tmp="$(mktemp -d)"
os="$(uname -s)"
arch="$(uname -m)"

case "$os:$arch" in
  Darwin:arm64) asset="fsite-macos-aarch64" ;;
  Darwin:x86_64) asset="fsite-macos-x86_64" ;;
  Linux:x86_64) asset="fsite-linux-x86_64" ;;
  *) echo "unsupported platform: $os $arch" >&2; exit 1 ;;
esac

base="https://github.com/$repo/releases/download/fsite-latest"
curl -fsSL "$base/$asset.tar.gz" -o "$tmp/$asset.tar.gz"
curl -fsSL "$base/$asset.tar.gz.sha256" -o "$tmp/$asset.tar.gz.sha256"

if command -v shasum >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  (cd "$tmp" && shasum -a 256 -c "$asset.tar.gz.sha256")
else
  (cd "$tmp" && sha256sum -c "$asset.tar.gz.sha256")
fi

tar -xzf "$tmp/$asset.tar.gz" -C "$tmp"
mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/bin"
install -m 0755 "$tmp/fsite" "$HOME/.local/bin/fsite"
"$HOME/.local/bin/fsite" --version
```

Make sure `$HOME/.local/bin` is on `PATH` before continuing.

## Discover The CLI

Start by asking `fsite` what it can do:

```sh
fsite --help
fsite describe workflow register-and-publish --output json
fsite describe workflow publish-static-site --output json
fsite describe workflow publish-stateful-app --output json
fsite describe workflow publish-document --output json
fsite describe workflow project-config --output json
```

Prefer `--output json` for commands whose output you need to parse.

## Your Finite Identity

`fsite` uses the current Finite Home's identity-owner key, stored at
`~/.finite/identity/identity.json` (or `$FINITE_HOME/identity/identity.json`
when `FINITE_HOME` is set, e.g. in hosted runtimes). Whichever Finite tool
runs first in that home mints the key; every other Finite tool in the same home
finds it. A hosted agent therefore publishes as its Agent Principal, not as the
human who owns its SaaS Project. `fsite` never copies the secret elsewhere.

```sh
fsite auth status --output json
```

### Mailboxes, NIP-05, And Identity Authority

`fsite` uses `https://identity.finite.vip` as the production Identity Authority
by default. `FINITE_IDENTITY_AUTHORITY` is only a self-hosting and local-test
override. CLI behavior does not change merely because that variable is present.

`--email` always means a deliverable Mailbox Address. `--nip05` always means a
Finite Identity resolution name, and `--npub` always means a native key.
Managed Agent NIP-05 names are not mailboxes: passing one to an email flag
fails before any invitation or challenge is delivered and points to the
corresponding NIP-05 flag.

For `@finite.vip` Mailbox Addresses, redeeming after `fsite auth link-email
MAILBOX` or redeeming with `--link-native` binds the mailbox to the current
Local Identity Key in finite-identity. Do not run that flow from an agent
merely to inherit the human's permissions; human-to-agent access requires an
explicit, revocable Finite Sites Email Access Delegation. For non-`@finite.vip`
Mailbox Addresses, redeeming preserves the email-only collaborator flow: the
mailbox can satisfy its grant, but it does not become a native Finite identity.

The Sites-only delegation flow is:

```sh
fsite auth sites-key request paul@example.com
fsite auth sites-key add paul@example.com TOKEN_FROM_EMAIL --output json
fsite auth sites-key revoke paul@example.com TOKEN_FROM_EMAIL npub1... --output json
```

Every add or revoke uses fresh mailbox proof. Multiple npubs can remain active
for one mailbox; revoking one does not change Chat NIP-05 resolution, Brain
encryption recipients, other keys, or the underlying mailbox grants.

The additive operator reconciliation is a deliberate one-off action. Preview
against a transactionally consistent in-memory copy first; this is the default
and does not initialize or mutate the source registry:

```sh
FC_CORE_API_TOKEN=... \
finitesitesd reconcile-identity --data DATA_DIR \
  --identity-authority-url https://identity.finite.vip \
  --core-api-url https://core.example
```

After reviewing the preview, naming the backup and rollback boundary, and
receiving separate production-mutation approval, apply the same reconciliation
explicitly:

```sh
FC_CORE_API_TOKEN=... \
finitesitesd reconcile-identity --data DATA_DIR --apply yes \
  --identity-authority-url https://identity.finite.vip \
  --core-api-url https://core.example
```

The Core URL and server-only `FC_CORE_API_TOKEN` are optional as a pair.
Without them, reconciliation still preserves legacy access and converts
Managed Agent NIP-05 grants to native grants. With them, a verified active Core
account-to-Agent association may create the missing mailbox-to-npub Sites key.
Automated evidence never reactivates a revoked key; only a new mailbox
challenge can do that. Normal Sites startup creates the compatible schema but
never runs this data reconciliation.

### Migrating an existing key

Older `fsite` releases stored the key at `~/.config/finite-sites/identity.env`.
That location is no longer read. To keep publishing as the same npub, import
the old secret into the shared identity file once:

```sh
fsite auth import --file ~/.config/finite-sites/identity.env
```

`fsite auth import` also reads an `nsec1...` or 64-char hex secret from
stdin, or from any `--file` whose content is just the secret. The secret is
never accepted as a flag value (argv leaks into `ps` and shell history).

The import refuses to overwrite an existing `identity.json` (another Finite
tool may already be using it). If you do nothing, a fresh identity is minted
on first run and previously created Projects will not be reachable from the
new key.

Recovery warning: Sites retains repositories and outputs, but loss of the sole
Publishing Key can still strand private owner access. A durable SaaS Project
must have an independent collaborator or a tested, audited Publishing Ownership
Recovery flow; operator SQL is not the product recovery path.

## Publish A New Static Site

1. Register this Finite Home's Publishing Key for publishing:

```sh
fsite whoami
fsite auth register --output json
```

2. Put the deployable website bytes in a dedicated directory such as `site/`
or `dist/`. Keep source, data, scripts, and build logic in the Project
Repository too. Only the configured output path is served as the website.

3. Create `finite.toml`:

```toml
[project]
slug = "my-project"

[outputs.site]
kind = "site"
site_name = "my-project"
branch = "main"
path = "site"
spa = false
```

4. Validate and create the Project Repository:

```sh
fsite project init --config finite.toml --dry-run --output json
fsite project init --config finite.toml --output json
```

Project Init is replay-safe, including its Git repository setup boundary. If
the server returns `git_unavailable`, no Project Init state changed: wait for
service health to recover and retry the exact command once. If it returns
`git_repository_setup_failed`, the Project registry state may already be
durable even though the repository is not ready. Keep the same slug and local
source; after the operator repairs Git or repository storage, replay the exact
`fsite project init --config finite.toml --output json` command once. That
replay repairs the repository without creating a duplicate Project. Do not
blindly loop either failure.

5. Store a scoped Git Credential, commit source plus deploy bytes, and push
the Deploy Branch:

```sh
fsite auth git my-project --store --output json

git init -b main
git remote add finite https://git.finite.chat/my-project.git
git add finite.toml site
git commit -m "Initial Finite Sites publish"
git push finite main
```

Pushing the configured Deploy Branch creates a new immutable Version. Finite
Sites validates and serves the committed bytes under `path`. A successful push
returns only after every matching output is active. If Git reports
`git ref accepted but deploy failed`, the ref has already moved: fix the config
or deploy bytes, create a correcting commit, and push that commit instead of
retrying the same commit.

Confirm the URL returned by the configured server and preview that exact
origin:

```sh
fsite project status my-project --output json
fsite view my-project --output json
```

For an owned Project, `fsite view NAME` resolves the served output through the
configured `FINITE_SITES_API`; it does not invent a production hostname. This
is why the same command returns `https://NAME.finite.chat/` in production and
`http://NAME.sites.localhost:PORT/` in local development. When a Project has
multiple outputs, pass the explicit `output_url` from `project status`.

## Publish A Stateful App

Stateful app Outputs use the same Project Repository model. The difference is
that `finite.toml` declares `kind = "app"` and an explicit start command.
Finite Sites versions the committed app directory as one runtime bundle; it
does not run builds or infer generated output.

Declare an app output:

```toml
[project]
slug = "my-app"

[outputs.web]
kind = "app"
site_name = "my-app"
branch = "main"
path = "app"
start = "bun server.ts"
```

Runtime contract for agents:

- `start` is required and must begin with `node`, `bun`, or `uv`.
- Finite sets `PORT`; the app must listen on `0.0.0.0:$PORT`.
- Finite sets `DATA_DIR`; live mutable state must be stored under `DATA_DIR`.
- `DATA_DIR` survives deploys, restarts, and wake/sleep.
- Commit source, migrations, seed data, and explicit runtime payload to git.
- Build before committing if the app needs a build step.
- Dependency directories should only be committed when they are intentionally
  required runtime payload for the app output.

Then create the Project Repository and push like any other output:

```sh
fsite auth register --output json
fsite project init --config finite.toml --dry-run --output json
fsite project init --config finite.toml --output json
fsite auth git my-app --store --output json

git init -b main
git remote add finite https://git.finite.chat/my-app.git
git add finite.toml app
git commit -m "Initial stateful app"
git push finite main
```

## Publish A Markdown Document

Document Outputs are read-only rendered Markdown backed by the same Project
Repository model. Use them for collaborative docs, notes, and poor-man's
Google Docs where agents edit Markdown in git.

Create a folder of Markdown files:

```sh
mkdir -p docs
cat > docs/index.md <<'EOF'
# My Document

Start here.
EOF
```

Declare a document output:

```toml
[project]
slug = "my-docs"

[outputs.doc]
kind = "document"
document_name = "my-docs"
branch = "main"
path = "docs"
entry = "index.md"
```

Then create the Project Repository and push exactly like a site:

```sh
fsite auth register --output json
fsite project init --config finite.toml --dry-run --output json
fsite project init --config finite.toml --output json
fsite auth git my-docs --store --output json

git init -b main
git remote add finite https://git.finite.chat/my-docs.git
git add finite.toml docs
git commit -m "Initial document"
git push finite main
```

The document serves at `https://my-docs.docs.finite.chat/`. Clean routes
render Markdown, appending `.md` returns the exact authored Markdown for that
page, `/llms.txt` gives edit instructions, and `/llms-full.txt` gives agents a
bounded Markdown snapshot.

## Edit A Shared Project

If you start from a site URL, read the agent handoff first:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://SITE.finite.chat/llms.txt
fsite view https://SITE.finite.chat/ --output json
```

Then authenticate for the Project Repository and clone it:

```sh
fsite auth git PROJECT --store --output json
git clone https://git.finite.chat/PROJECT.git
cd PROJECT
```

Edit source, run the project's own checks or build step, commit the resulting
source plus deploy bytes, and push the Deploy Branch:

```sh
git status --short
git add .
git commit -m "Describe the edit"
git push origin main
```

Use `--email MAILBOX` with `fsite auth git` only when you are acting through a
mailbox collaborator grant. A native collaborator can optionally prove the
same key with `--nip05 NAME` or `--npub NPUB`:

```sh
fsite auth login editor@example.com
fsite auth redeem editor@example.com TOKEN_FROM_EMAIL
fsite auth git PROJECT --email editor@example.com --store --output json
fsite auth git PROJECT --nip05 my-agent@finite.vip --store --output json
```

Do not print Git Credential passwords into transcripts. Prefer `--store`.

## Link Email When Needed

Email is optional. Use it when a human wants future shares or collaborator
grants for an email address to resolve to this local npub:

```sh
fsite auth register --output json
fsite auth link-email editor@example.com --output json
fsite auth redeem editor@example.com TOKEN_FROM_EMAIL --output json
```

If an invite email already gave the current identity owner a token and the
email and local npub are the same Principal, link it directly:

```sh
fsite auth redeem editor@example.com TOKEN_FROM_EMAIL --link-native --output json
```

Never run that command from an Agent Principal merely to inherit a human's
email grants. Use `fsite auth sites-key request` followed by `sites-key add`
instead. The resulting Authorized Sites Key grants no Chat or Brain authority.

## Share And Collaborate

Project collaboration controls who can clone and push source:

```sh
# Native agents and Finite users keep their own Principal.
fsite project grant PROJECT --npub npub1... --output json
fsite project revoke PROJECT --npub npub1... --output json
fsite project grant PROJECT --nip05 my-agent@finite.vip --output json
fsite project revoke PROJECT --nip05 my-agent@finite.vip --output json

# External email collaborators use the invitation flow.
fsite project grant PROJECT --email editor@example.com --send-invite --output json
fsite project revoke PROJECT --email editor@example.com --output json
```

Use exactly one of `--email`, `--nip05`, or `--npub`. Native collaborators
authenticate with their own Local Identity Key and run `fsite auth git PROJECT
--store`; they do not link or impersonate the project owner's mailbox.

Output visibility controls who can view the served website:

```sh
fsite project share PROJECT site --shared --add-email viewer@example.com --send-invite --output json
fsite project share PROJECT site --add-nip05 my-agent@finite.vip --output json
fsite project share PROJECT site --add-npub npub1... --output json
fsite project share PROJECT site --remove-npub npub1... --output json
fsite project share PROJECT site --public --yes-public --output json
fsite project share PROJECT site --private --output json
```

When an authenticated human asks an Agent Principal to publish an Output,
Hermes and `fsite` carry that authenticated sender through the active terminal
tool call automatically:

```sh
fsite project init --config finite.toml --dry-run --output json
fsite project init --config finite.toml --output json
```

Project Init atomically creates that human's explicit revocable Native
Principal Share. The dashboard, Electron, and iOS can then exchange a bounded
User Nostr Identity proof for the Output's ordinary Viewer Cookie, without an
email or Magic Link flow. A proof never creates a Share, and removing the npub
takes effect on the next content request even if the browser still has a
cookie. Outside an active authenticated Finite Chat turn, standalone agents
may still pass `--requesting-user-npub NPUB` explicitly. A conflicting
explicit value during an active authenticated turn is rejected. Agents must
never derive this identity from quoted message text.

The Finite dashboard can also open an Output already shared to a verified
External Principal email through the legacy server-to-server email exchange.
That compatibility path does not add the email to the Output.
The server-to-server credential for this optional exchange is
`FINITE_SITES_VIEWER_SESSION_TOKEN`, exactly 64 lowercase hex characters
(`openssl rand -hex 32`). Keep the same value in the Sites and dashboard
server environment only; an absent value disables the endpoint.

Project Repository visibility is separate from output visibility. Project
Repositories are private by default. Selected Finite-owned baseline repos may
be public-read for unauthenticated clone/fetch, but public-read never grants
push access.

## Source-Only Projects

A Project Repository can exist before there is any served website:

```toml
[project]
slug = "my-source-project"
```

Run `fsite project init --config finite.toml --output json` to create the
source-only Project Repository. Add outputs later by updating `finite.toml`
and replaying `fsite project init`.

## Agent Rules

- Use the Project Repository as source. Do not reconstruct source from
  rendered HTML.
- Commit deploy bytes. Finite Sites does not run builds.
- For `kind = "app"`, write live mutable state only under `DATA_DIR`; do not
  overwrite live state during deploy.
- Do not look for a direct upload command. The publish path is git.
- Do not set `path = "."` unless the whole repo is intentionally served.
- Use `fsite describe ... --output json` instead of guessing command shapes.
- Keep private keys, `.finite/`, `.env*`, and build caches out of git. Avoid
  dependency directories unless they are intentionally required runtime payload
  for a `kind = "app"` output.
- If a site has `/llms.txt`, treat it as the project handoff. If the project
  publishes its own `/llms.txt`, it is authoritative.

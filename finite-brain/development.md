# FiniteBrain Development Guide

This document is for humans and agents working on the FiniteBrain codebase.
The root `README.md` is intentionally agent-first and focuses on installing
and using `fbrain`.

Read `CONTEXT.md` before changing code. It defines the product vocabulary used
by code, docs, tests, skills, and prompts.

## Product Shape

FiniteBrain is an encrypted knowledge system where trusted clients and agent
runtimes open Folder Keys locally, materialize readable Pages as markdown, and
sync encrypted changes back to the server.

A Brain is a namespace of many Folder-scoped LLM wikis. Folder access is the
wiki boundary: each top-level Folder owns its own `_index.md`, `config.md`,
`log.md`, sources, compiled pages, outputs, and access-safe activity trail.

Current v1 capabilities:

- SQLite-backed Brains, Folders, Folder Key Grants, invitations, shares, mounts,
  and encrypted sync records.
- Nostr-authenticated protected HTTP routes.
- Product Client at `/client` for browser-based trusted-client workflows.
- Development Smoke UI at `/smoke/ui` for local inspection only.
- `fbrain` CLI for agent-native Brain Working Trees.
- Folder-scoped AGENTS/HUMANS guidance and LLM wiki conventions that trusted
  clients or agents can add when a user explicitly asks for them. New Brains
  start empty under ADR-0021.

## Local Development

Common checks:

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo build --workspace
```

Run the local server:

```sh
FINITE_BRAIN_ADDR=127.0.0.1:3015 \
FINITE_BRAIN_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3015 \
FINITE_BRAIN_DB=.dev-data/finite-brain.sqlite3 \
cargo run -p finite-brain-app
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3015/client
http://127.0.0.1:3015/smoke/ui
```

Use the CLI through Cargo during development:

```sh
cargo run -p finite-brain-cli --bin fbrain -- --version
cargo run -p finite-brain-cli --bin fbrain -- doctor --server http://127.0.0.1:3015
cargo run -p finite-brain-cli --bin fbrain -- auth status --json
```

Or build once and use `target/debug/fbrain`.

## `fbrain` Agent Workflow

Use `fbrain` as the agent-facing command. Agents work in a Brain Working Tree
with ordinary file tools; `fbrain` owns identity, server transport, Folder Key
opening, local daemon state, sync, conflicts, access inspection, and safe
administration commands.

Useful commands:

```sh
fbrain doctor --server "$FINITE_BRAIN_SERVER_URL"
fbrain auth status --json
fbrain brain list --json
fbrain open <brain-id>
cd "${FBRAIN_WORKING_TREE_ROOT:-.}/<brain-id>"
fbrain sync now --summary
fbrain conflicts --json
fbrain search "credential rotation" --json
fbrain status --json
fbrain activity
fbrain folder list --brain <brain-id>
fbrain access list --brain <brain-id>
```

Use global `--config-dir <path>` when an agent needs a dedicated signer/config
directory without relying on shell-level environment persistence:

```sh
fbrain --config-dir "$HOME/.config/finitebrain" auth status --json
```

`fbrain` resolves server URLs in this order:

1. explicit `--server`
2. saved Brain Working Tree server URL
3. `FINITE_BRAIN_SERVER_URL`
4. legacy `FINITE_BRAIN_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`

The CLI accepts `https://` endpoints and `http://` only for localhost,
loopback addresses, or the exact development host explicitly named by
`FINITE_BRAIN_DEVELOPMENT_HTTP_HOST`.

## Environment Variables

- `FINITE_BRAIN_ADDR`: server bind address, default `127.0.0.1:3015`.
- `FINITE_BRAIN_SERVER_URL`: agent/CLI transport base URL. This may be an
  internal or host-bridge address.
- `FINITE_BRAIN_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`: browser-visible canonical Brain origin. The
  CLI signs this origin into Nostr HTTP authorization events even when it sends
  the request through a different `FINITE_BRAIN_SERVER_URL`; it is also the
  legacy transport fallback when no server URL is configured.
- `FINITE_BRAIN_DEVELOPMENT_HTTP_HOST`: local-harness-only exact HTTP host
  allowlist entry for an Apple Container host bridge.
- `FINITE_BRAIN_DB`: SQLite database path, default `finite-brain.sqlite3`.
- `FINITE_IDENTITY_AUTHORITY`: finite-identity Authority base URL used by
  email-targeted Brain Invitation claims to verify current email proof, and by
  `fbrain auth login|redeem` for email proof. `fbrain` defaults to the public
  Authority `https://identity.finite.vip`; this variable is an override.
- `FINITE_BRAIN_INVITE_MAILER`: optional Brain invite delivery mode: `dev`,
  `resend`, or `none`.
- `FINITE_BRAIN_INVITE_MAIL_FROM`: sender address for `resend`.
- `FBRAIN_CONFIG_DIR`: local `fbrain` config directory for prototype signer
  state. Prefer global `--config-dir` in scripts and agent runtimes.
- `FBRAIN_WORKING_TREE_ROOT`: optional default parent for `fbrain open`; hosted
  Agent Runtimes set this below `/data/workspace`.

`fbrain search <query>` uses private, persistent per-Folder BM25 indexes over
the readable Markdown Sections in the current Brain Working Tree. It searches
all readable Folders by default; repeat `--folder <id-or-path>` to narrow the
scope. If mounted Folders reuse an ID, select one with
`--folder <source-brain-id>:<folder-id>`. Use `--limit <1-50>` to bound
evidence and `--json` for agents; JSON evidence includes `sourceBrainId`.
Each Folder keeps its own BM25 corpus; query-time BM25 relevance is normalized
within that Folder before the candidate lists are merged, with raw BM25 as the
cross-Folder tie-break. The final lexical order therefore remains BM25-derived
without comparing unnormalized per-Folder scales.
Search indexes are disposable derived state under `.finitebrain/`, never synced
knowledge or a Recovery Set.

## Test Expectations

- Protocol, storage, sync, crypto-adjacent, and access-control changes need
  positive tests plus stale/replay/negative tests where relevant.
- SQLite behavior should be tested through persistence/reopen paths when a
  migration or transaction invariant matters.
- Before handoff, run `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo test --workspace`, and
  `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`.

For release confidence, also run:

```sh
cargo build --locked --release --package finite-brain-cli --bin fbrain
```

## Release Shape

Component tags named `fbrain/vX.Y.Z` trigger
`.depot/workflows/release-fbrain.yml` from the monorepo root. The workflow
publishes the versioned release and refreshes the `fbrain-latest` rolling alias.

The GitHub release packages `fbrain` binaries for:

- `fbrain-linux-x86_64`
- `fbrain-macos-aarch64`
- `fbrain-macos-x86_64`

Each asset is uploaded as `.tar.gz` with a matching `.sha256` file.

The Linux `finite-brain` server binary is also published as
`finite-brain-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` for the smoke bridge. Normal production
deployment builds the server through Nix from the exact monorepo revision.

Before tagging:

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo build --locked --release --package finite-brain-cli --bin fbrain
```

## Safety And Public Repo Rules

Do not commit:

- Nostr private keys, `nsec` values, auth files, or signer state.
- Folder Keys, grant plaintext, rotation bodies, or decrypted sync internals.
- Live SQLite databases, backups, runtime PVC contents, or smoke/prod user data.
- Tokens, `.env*`, API keys, OAuth secrets, Telegram secrets, or deploy keys.

Do commit:

- Rust source, docs, tests, Product Client source assets, specs, ADRs, and
  reusable agent skill instructions.
- Redacted smoke findings and commands that do not expose live secrets or user
  data.

Public docs may reference the smoke service URL, local loopback development
URLs, and release download URLs. They must not imply that the development Smoke
UI is the production client.

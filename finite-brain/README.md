# FiniteBrain

FiniteBrain is Finite Computer's encrypted, folder-scoped knowledge system for
humans and agents.

If a human asks you to work in a FiniteBrain brain, use the `fbrain` CLI. A
Brain Working Tree is the editable local source of truth for an agent: sync
first, edit ordinary markdown in readable Folders, then sync encrypted changes
back. Each key-using operation reopens encrypted Folder Key Grants in memory;
there is no durable CLI unlock state.

The production service is reached through `https://finite.computer`.
Use `https://finite.computer/client` for the Product Client.

## Install `fbrain`

Install the latest release binary:

```sh
set -eu

tmp="$(mktemp -d)"
os="$(uname -s)"
arch="$(uname -m)"

case "$os:$arch" in
  Darwin:arm64) asset="fbrain-macos-aarch64" ;;
  Darwin:x86_64) asset="fbrain-macos-x86_64" ;;
  Linux:x86_64) asset="fbrain-linux-x86_64" ;;
  *) echo "unsupported platform: $os $arch" >&2; exit 1 ;;
esac

base="https://github.com/finitecomputer/finite-releases/releases/download/fbrain-latest"
curl -fsSL "$base/$asset.tar.gz" -o "$tmp/$asset.tar.gz"
curl -fsSL "$base/$asset.tar.gz.sha256" -o "$tmp/$asset.tar.gz.sha256"

if command -v shasum >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  (cd "$tmp" && shasum -a 256 -c "$asset.tar.gz.sha256")
else
  (cd "$tmp" && sha256sum -c "$asset.tar.gz.sha256")
fi

tar -xzf "$tmp/$asset.tar.gz" -C "$tmp"
mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/bin"
install -m 0755 "$tmp/fbrain" "$HOME/.local/bin/fbrain"
"$HOME/.local/bin/fbrain" --version
```

Make sure `$HOME/.local/bin` is on `PATH` before continuing.

## Discover The CLI

Start by asking `fbrain` what it can do:

```sh
fbrain --help
fbrain doctor --server https://finite.computer
fbrain auth status --json
```

Prefer `--json` for commands whose output an agent needs to parse.

## Identity

`fbrain` signs with the Local Identity Key for the current Finite Home. In a
hosted runtime this is the agent's key shared only by that runtime's Finite
tools (`fsite`, `finitechat`, `fbrain`). The identity lives at
`$FINITE_HOME/identity/identity.json` when `FINITE_HOME` is set and at
`~/.finite/identity/identity.json` otherwise; whichever Finite tool runs first
mints the key, and every other tool in that home finds it. `fbrain` never
copies the secret into its own config directory.

```sh
# Show the identity without creating or changing anything.
fbrain auth status --json

# Adopt an existing secret (nsec1... or 64-char hex) as the shared identity.
# The secret is read from stdin or --file, never from argv.
fbrain auth import < secret.txt
fbrain auth import --file secret.txt
```

`auth import` refuses to overwrite an existing identity; move the old file
aside by hand if you mean it. If no identity exists, the first `fbrain`
command that needs to sign mints one automatically.

Recovery warning: the server cannot reconstruct Folder Keys after loss of the
sole Nostr key. A server database backup can therefore restore valid ciphertext
that nobody can open. Durable SaaS use is blocked until each Folder has a tested
user-held or Finite-assisted Recovery Principal/key path and that path reopens
the Folder on an empty replacement client.

The legacy `fbrain auth login --nsec` flow and its plaintext
`<config-dir>/auth.json` are a hard cut and are no longer read. To keep a
legacy key, import it once:

```sh
jq -r .secretKey "$FBRAIN_CONFIG_DIR/auth.json" | fbrain auth import
rm "$FBRAIN_CONFIG_DIR/auth.json"
```

### Email Proof

`fbrain auth login EMAIL` requests an email challenge and
`fbrain auth redeem EMAIL TOKEN` proves that email with the shared Finite
identity against the public finite-identity Authority
(`https://identity.finite.vip`, overridable with
`FINITE_IDENTITY_AUTHORITY`). For `@finite.vip` emails, redemption binds the
email to the current
Local Identity Key in finite-identity and returns the NIP-05 identifier for
that email. Run this binding flow only when the email and current key identify
the same Principal. An agent must not redeem a human's email to inherit the
human identity. Brain instead records exactly one distinct Personal Agent for
a Personal Brain and automatically grants it every current and future Folder
Key. The owner can atomically replace or remove it; ownership always stays
with the human User Nostr Identity.

User-first creation resolves the Managed Agent Email before creating the empty
Personal Brain. Agent-first creation uses the signed
`POST /v1/personal-brain-bootstrap` route; Brain derives the owning account
through Core and the human public identity through Finite Identity. Chat does
not issue a Brain setup ticket or grant.

Hosted `/client` uses `finite-brain-identity-provider-v1` through the
WorkOS-bound dashboard bridge. The dashboard injects a signed, expiring
capability into a server-sandboxed Brain frame. For every operation, the parent
dashboard supplies a short-lived proof bound to that exact request and its live
WorkOS session; the parent never receives the frame capability, and ordinary
dashboard code has no ambient signer route. The custody executor loads the existing Chat Hosted
Device User Key and never returns it or performs arbitrary NIP-44 operations;
without prior Chat setup, Brain shows setup-required and does not mint a
replacement identity.

External email redemption is recorded as email-only identity proof in
finite-identity, but FiniteBrain folder sharing still requires an npub target
for encrypted Folder Key Grants. Email-address folder grants are intentionally
left for a future crypto-aware slice.

## Open A Brain Working Tree

Use an explicit config directory in agent runtimes so fbrain state does not
depend on shell persistence (the identity itself always resolves from the
shared location above):

```sh
export FINITE_BRAIN_SERVER_URL=https://brain.finite.computer
export FBRAIN_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.config/finitebrain"

fbrain --config-dir "$FBRAIN_CONFIG_DIR" auth status --json
fbrain --config-dir "$FBRAIN_CONFIG_DIR" open <brain-id> "$HOME/finitebrain/<brain-id>"
cd "$HOME/finitebrain/<brain-id>"
fbrain --config-dir "$FBRAIN_CONFIG_DIR" doctor
fbrain --config-dir "$FBRAIN_CONFIG_DIR" repair # only when doctor reports an insecure boundary
fbrain --config-dir "$FBRAIN_CONFIG_DIR" sync now --summary
fbrain --config-dir "$FBRAIN_CONFIG_DIR" conflicts --json
fbrain --config-dir "$FBRAIN_CONFIG_DIR" search "credential rotation" --json
```

A Brain Working Tree is intentional persistent plaintext on the Trusted Device.
Pausing sync, stopping `fbrain`, restarting the device, or clearing Session
Folder Keys does not hide or remove its member-authored files. `fbrain repair`
only restores owner-only permissions on the Working Tree root and
Finite-managed `.finitebrain/` state; it never recursively changes member
content. Removing a Working Tree is an ordinary filesystem deletion and makes
no secure-erasure promise for device storage, backups, snapshots, or prior
copies.

The first current `fbrain` command that reads legacy v1 Agent State atomically
rewrites it as v2 without `localFolderKeys` or `unlockedFolders` before
continuing. Replacing the active file removes those values from the current
state only; it is not secure erasure from backups, snapshots, filesystem
history, or prior copies. Encrypted grants and recovery artifacts remain the
authority for reopening access.

Before editing, read the Brain Working Tree's `AGENTS.md`, `HUMANS.md`,
Folder-local `_index.md`, `config.md`, and `log.md` files when present.

## Agent Rules

- Sync before editing and after meaningful changes.
- Only edit readable materialized Folder contents.
- Do not edit `.finitebrain/`, encrypted sync evidence, locked metadata-only
  folders, auth files, key material, or generated state files.
- Treat every readable top-level Folder as its own LLM wiki scope.
- Keep each Folder's `_index.md` and `log.md` local to that Folder.
- Keep non-Markdown Asset bytes outside the Brain.
- Represent every Asset with one Markdown Asset Source Note under that Folder's
  `raw/` tree. Record `type`, `title`, and the canonical `resource` URI, then
  cite the note from synthesized `wiki/` pages.
- Never summarize restricted Folder contents into less-restricted Folders,
  indexes, logs, or outputs.
- Do not print or expose Nostr secrets, Folder Keys, grant plaintext, auth
  files, decrypted sync internals, or rotation bodies.

## Developers

If you want to understand, run, or modify FiniteBrain itself, see
[`development.md`](development.md).

The core implementation contract is the FiniteBrain Portable v1 specification:

- [`docs/specs/finitebrain-portability-spec.md`](docs/specs/finitebrain-portability-spec.md)

This repository is the active Rust implementation target and includes the
first-party Product Client prototype served at `/client`. The previous
SilverBullet/TypeScript fork is legacy archive material, not part of the active
workspace or compatibility surface.

The Product Client starts with its content session locked. **Resume session**
uses the connected Member Identity to reopen encrypted Folder Key Grants and
rebuild readable Pages, drafts, search, graph, and access views in memory.
**Lock session** clears that in-memory keyring, opened-grant metadata, decrypted
projections, drafts, prepared writes, import plans, invite secrets, and rendered
plaintext. Switching Brains uses the same clearing boundary. It does not change
or delete the external signer identity. Navigating away, entering the browser
back/forward cache, or receiving a signature from a different signer identity
also locks the session before protected work can continue.

An invitation-link fragment is removed from browser history immediately and
held only as a one-shot, in-memory pre-session capability. It enters invitation
controls after explicit **Resume session**; explicit Lock, Brain switching, or a
failed Resume discards it.

The first-party browser client does not write raw Folder Keys or decrypted
FiniteBrain content to Web Storage, IndexedDB, Cache Storage, cookies, or
browser history. Encrypted server sync remains allowed. Unprompted plaintext
egress is denied, while an explicit export or send remains a controller action;
FiniteBrain cannot control a third-party client after an authorized Member
Identity decrypts content.
